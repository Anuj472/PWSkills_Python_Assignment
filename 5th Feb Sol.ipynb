    "Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.A class is not allocated memory when it is defined. An object is allocated memory when it is created. Class is a logical entity whereas objects are physical entities."
